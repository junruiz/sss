    <h1>Welcome to the World of Saxophone!</h1>

    <h2>How Saxophones Work</h2>
    <p>
      The saxophone sings through the power of air! When you blow into the
      mouthpiece, your breath makes a reed vibrate, producing sound. These
      sounds travel through the saxophone's body, coming out richer and fuller.
      It's like magic, but with a bit of science sprinkled on top. The keys you
      press change the pitch by opening and closing holes along the saxophone,
      allowing you to play different notes and melodies.
    </p>

    <h2>Different Types of Saxophones</h2>
    <p>
      Did you know there are several types of saxophones? Each brings its own
      flavor to the music they make:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Soprano Saxophone</strong>: The highest pitch of the common
        saxes, sleek and straight, often leading the melody.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Alto Saxophone</strong>: A bit deeper, very popular in school
        bands and jazz for its versatile sound.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tenor Saxophone</strong>: Rich and warm, the tenor sax has a
        voice that can fill a room with soulful tunes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baritone Saxophone</strong>: The deep, gruff member of the
        family, adding a robust foundation to sax ensembles.
      </li>
    </ul>
